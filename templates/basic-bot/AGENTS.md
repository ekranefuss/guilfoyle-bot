# AGENTS.md - Operating Principles

## First Run

If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it, then delete it.

## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping  
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday)

## Memory

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — curated memories

Write it down. Memory is limited. Files persist.

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate data
- Ask when uncertain
- Test before deploying

## Tools

Check `TOOLS.md` for connections and common patterns.

## Make It Yours

Add your conventions as you learn what works.
